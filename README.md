Nowadays, Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is permitted to measure individual cell gene expression.
This gene expression data would provide insights to distinguish cell types with different biological functions. In this
data camp project, we aim to construct a pipeline with machine learning models to classify 4 cell types: Cancer
cells, NK cells, T cells CD4+, T cells CD8+ using a subset of the scRNA-seq data from the scMARK benchmark
dataset. We present a supervised classification approach using machine learning models to accurately classify
these 4 cell types based on gene expression data of individual cells. Our approach consists of quality control, data
normalization, and feature selection to improve the performance of the classification pipeline. The performance of
the pipeline is evaluated using balance accuracy. All the programming and computing will be done in Python.
